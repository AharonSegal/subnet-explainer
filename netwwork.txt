## Subnet Calculation for 59.89.212.216/14

- **Step 1: Transition byte and initial calculation** 
    the transition byte is /14
    meaning the base ir 32 bits
    00000000/00000000/00000000/00000000
    14 means there are 14 ones in the end of the sequence
    so now we replace the zeros with ones starting from the left 
    this results in 
    11111111/11111100/00000000/00000000
    this will be used to find the subnet 
    more specificly the transistion byte

    
    we will do 2 calculation for finding all we need 
    1- the value of the byte -> 11111100 = 88
      then compare this 88 with the original number with and op bin of 89
      transition_byte = 1111 1100 = 252
      original_ip     = 0101 1001 = 89
      - Compare IP bytes with subnet mask using AND:  

      AND_OP_RES    = 0101 1000 = 88
      the transistion byte of the local ip is 88

      
    - 1st byte: 59 → stays 59  
    - 2nd byte: 212 AND 252 (`11111100`) = 88
     ↓  
  - **Result:** second section is 88  
  - **Full network IP:** 59.88.0.0

- **Step 2: First Host**  
  - No calculation needed  
  - First host = full network IP + 1 → 59.88.0.1

- **Step 3: Last Host calculation**  
  - Find size of subnetwork → how many hosts can be connected  
  - Subnet mask in binary: `11111111/11111100/00000000/00000000`  
  - Look at the byte where the subnet transition occurs (2nd byte)  
  - Zeros in this byte determine the max number: `00` → max = 3  
  - Add to second number: 88 + 3 = 91 ↓  
  - **Last Host:** 59.91.255.254  
    - 59: network portion  
    - 91: partial host section added with optional subnets  
    - 255: maxed out  
    - 254: leave last for broadcast  
  - This subnet can have `(91-88) * 255 * 254` usable IPs for hosts

- **Step 4: Broadcast Address**  
  - Broadcast = last host + 1 → 59.91.255.255  
  - Final max option in the subnet

- **Step 5: Next Subnet**  
  - Next IP available after this subnet = broadcast + 1 → 59.92.0.0

- **Summary of Steps**  
  1. Check size of subnet and find transition byte  
  2. Compare transition byte with IP section to calculate network  
  3. Find last host by maximizing zeros in transition byte  
  4. Add 1 to get broadcast  
  5. Add 1 to broadcast to get next subnet

the transition byte is /14
                BASE
00000000/00000000/00000000/00000000
                SUBMASK
11111111/11111100/00000000/00000000

transistion byte     -> 11111100

the value of the byte -> 11111100 = 88
transition_byte = 1111 1100 = 252
original_ip     = 0101 1001 = 89
AND_OP_RES      = 0101 1000 = 88
    
1st byte: 59 → stays 59  
2nd byte: 212 AND 252 (`11111100`) = 88
    ↓  
Full network IP: 59.88.0.0

Step 2: First Host
- First host = full network IP + 1 → 59.88.0.1

Step 3: Last Host calculation**  
transition_byte = 11111100 
- Zeros in this byte determine the max number: `00` → max = 3  
- Add to second number: 88 + 3 = 91 
          ↓  
- **Last Host:** 59.91.255.254  
  - 59: network portion  
  - 91: partial host section added with optional subnets  
  - 255: maxed out  
  - 254: leave last for broadcast  
- This subnet can have `(91-88) * 255 * 254` usable IPs for hosts

Step 4: Broadcast Address  
- Broadcast = last host + 1 → 59.91.255.255  
- Final max option in the subnet

Step 5: Next Subnet  
- Next IP available after this subnet = broadcast + 1 → 59.92.0.0

# Multicast Transmission (IPv4)

- **Purpose:** Reduce network traffic by sending a single packet to multiple subscribed hosts.
- **Multicast IP Range:** 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255
- **Subscribed Hosts:** Called multicast clients; only they process packets sent to the multicast address.
- **Subscription Protocol:** IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
  - Hosts send **join/leave messages** to routers/switches.
- **Network Filtering:**
  - **Switches:** Use IGMP snooping to forward multicast packets **only to subscribed ports**.
  - **Routers:** Use multicast routing protocols (e.g., PIM) to forward packets only where needed.
- **Example:**  
  - 5 hosts in a subnet; only 3 subscribe to 239.1.1.1 → only those 3 receive the packets.
- **Protocol-Specific Multicast:**  
  - Some protocols (e.g., OSPF) use reserved multicast addresses (224.0.0.x). Only devices using that protocol process the packets.


  # IPv4 Address Types

IPv4 addresses can be categorized based on purpose, range, and usage.

---

## 1. Public (Global) IP Address
- **Definition:** Routable on the Internet.
- **Range:** Any IP not reserved for private, loopback, or special purposes.
- **Use:** Devices communicating over the Internet.
- **Example:** `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
- **Class Identification:**  
  - 1–126 → Class A  
  - 128–191 → Class B  
  - 192–223 → Class C

---

## 2. Private IP Address
- **Definition:** Reserved for internal networks; not routable on the Internet.
- **Ranges (RFC 1918):**
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
- **Use:** Home, office LANs, internal devices.
- **Example:** `192.168.1.10`

---

## 3. Loopback Address
- **Definition:** Used by a device to communicate with itself.
- **Range:** 127.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 (commonly `127.0.0.1`)
- **Use:** Testing network software, internal communication.
- **Example:** `ping 127.0.0.1`

---

## 4. Link-Local Address
- **Definition:** Automatically assigned when no IP is available via DHCP.
- **Range:** 169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255
- **Use:** Local subnet communication; non-routable.
- **Example:** Laptop assigns `169.254.12.34` if DHCP fails.

---

## 5. Other Special Addresses
- **Experimental / Reserved:** 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.254  
  - Reserved for future use; not used in normal networks.
- **Broadcast Address:** 255.255.255.255  
  - Sends a packet to all devices in the subnet.
